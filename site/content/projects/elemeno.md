## Elemeno
Elemeno is an API-Based, Headless CMS designed to manage content for digital projects on any platform or device.

## Use Content Anywhere
Deliver your content to any platform using any programming language, framework or library. Youâ€™re not restricted by your CMS anymore.

## Friendly API
All of your content is delivered via our easy to use RESTful API allowing you to fetch your content wherever and whenever you need it.

## Easy Content Modelling
Quickly and easily define your content model using our drag and drop interface with input types for all your content needs.

## Cloud Based
No software to install, no databases to maintain. You manage your content, we'll manage everything else.

## Blazing Fast CDN
Your media files will be served from our lightning fast CDN. We'll even extract useful metadata about your media and deliver it with your content.

## Content Versioning
We keep track of every change you make to a content entry so you can easily revert to an earlier version at any time.
